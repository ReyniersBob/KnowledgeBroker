# UI
## whats the plan
The purpose of this application is to store knowledge in different forms 
(which can be pdf-books, links to learning sites, links to youtube or preview, films, ...)
with a freedom to order this however you want.
What can we use for this ux
 * Angular material
 * Drag and drop
 * Grid
 => Found Gridster which does both (drag and drop + grid)
